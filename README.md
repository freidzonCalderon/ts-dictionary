# Typescript Dictionary Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## [Live Demo Click Here](https://simple-dictionary-project.netlify.app/).

This project was build with React JS, Typescript, Tailwind and it is fetching data from the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). I used Axios to fetch the data. 

### Technologies used: React JS, Typescript, Tailwind, Axios.

To search for a word within the dictionary, simply type the word that you are looking for and press the search button.
